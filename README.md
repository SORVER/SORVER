# You are in Abdelsalam's Github Profile !!

 I'm Abdelsalam Mostafa, 19 years old and very optimistic to do something great in this world.
In my childhood I like mathematics and I was looking for a way to implement the things that I learned after a while I started thinking about how websites work and after a simple search I found the resources to learn how to make a website I learned HTML and CSS then I saw the Nextcoders scholarship in the internet I got the acceptance email and I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and python. And I graduated from it among the first 400 persons. So they let us have another course in Data Science. And I learned Python, Jupiter notebook, Numpy, pandas, and a few libraries.

After that, I graduated from abbas el Akkad language school and entered El Shorouk Academy faculty of computers and information technology. this part of my life changed my thinking by a good percentage. I learned problem-solving in the SHA ICPC training and I learned Data Structures and some algorithms with C++. Now I still training for the ECPC contest and still solving problems on the Codeforces site.
